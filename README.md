# Why?
Basically I want to improve my c++ skills, that is why I am going to recreate NES Tetris. I would love to do that with OpenGL, but I am unsure if I could do that yet, which is why I am going to use raylib for this project.

# Rules
1. I am not allowed to use any libraries except the raylibs, c++ standard libraries which I can include without the need to install something (e.g. &lt;vector&gt; or &lt;random&gt;) and selfmade libraries (which I dont have yet)
2. All features implemented must work exactly like in the original NES Tetris Version
3. Obviously, but I wont use any tutorials the entire code and the structure of the code will be planned by myself. The only thing is that I can use documentations to read how certain functions/classes and whatever work

# Goal
My goal is to recreate the full game with all features including:
- all screens
- A and B type gameplay
- highscores that can be saved
- original soundtracks and sounds

# You found this Repository
If you found this by any chance, you can use this repository in any way you want. If you just want to look the the code I dont mind. The only thing I want is that you please tell me if you directly use my code and for what reason, if it for your assignment that you didnt have time to create or for lecturing purposes or as an example.
I dont mind for what you use it, I just like to know what the reason is, e.g. when its a lecturing youtube video I would love to see it myself, thats the only reason. You can even use the entire code base.
  
If your interested, this is where I did most of my planning: https://link.excalidraw.com/readonly/Gz9QC6Cmn94MSuyZ0p3G
